		      This is the README file for FiXme,
	 a LaTeX package for putting fixme notes in draft documents.

	   copyright (C) 1998-99 Didier Verna. All rights reserved.


	This package provides a macro \fixme{} which you can use to generate
fixme notes in documents being developped. According to several package
options, such notes can appear in the margin of the document, as index
entries, in the log file and as warnings on stdout. If your document is in
final version, any remaining fixme notes will produce an error.

	To install the package, first run LaTeX on the `fixme.ins' file. This
will create the style file `fixme.sty' which you must install into a place
searched by LaTeX (see the TEXINPUTS variable). Then, you can typeset the
documentation by running LaTeX on the file `fixme.dtx'.

	Please refer to the top of the `fixme.ins' file for details on the
copyright terms and conditions.

	Have fun!
