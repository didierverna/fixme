FiXme consists of the following files:

- README (this file)
- NEWS
- fixme.ins
- fixme.dtx
- fixme.el


* Description
=============

	This package provides you with a way of inserting fixme notes in your
documents. Such notes can appear inline, as marginal notes, footnotes, index
entries, in the log file and as warnings on stdout. It is also possible to
summarize them in a list. When you switch from draft to final mode, any
remaining fixme note will be logged, but removed from the document's body.
Additionally, critical notes will abort compilation with an informative
message. FiXme also comes with support for AUC-TeX.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.ins' to create the style file `fixme.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.dtx' to create the doc   file `fixme.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `fixme.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

	Have fun!
