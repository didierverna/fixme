FiXme consists of the following files:

- README (this file)
- fixme.ins
- fixme.dtx
- fixme.el


* Description
=============

	This package provides you with a way of inserting fixme notes in
documents being developped (in draft mode). Such notes can appear in the
margin of the document, as index entries, in the log file and as warnings on
stdout. It is also possible to summarize them in a list, and in the index. If
your document is in a final version, any remaining fixme note will produce an
error. FiXme also comes with support for AUC-TeX.


* Changes
=========

** Version 1.5
--------------
*** New appearance: `text'. Directly in the text, in parentheses.

** Version 1.4
--------------
*** Support for the koma-script classes.
*** Fix bug reported by Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@physik.phy.tu-dresden.de>:
the list of fixme's didn't work when called before the first fixme note.

** Version 1.3
--------------
*** Support for Italian thanks to Riccardo Murri <murri@phc.unipi.it>

** Version 1.2
--------------
*** Support for German thanks to Harald Harders <h.harders@tu-bs.de>


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.ins' to create the style file `fixme.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.dtx' to create the doc   file `fixme.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `fixme.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

	Have fun!
