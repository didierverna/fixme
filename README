FiXme consists of the following files:

- README (this file)
- fixme.ins
- fixme.dtx
- fixme.el


* Description
=============

	This package provides you with a way to insert fixme notes in
documents being developped (in draft mode). Such notes can appear in the
margin of the document, as index entries, in the log file and as warnings on
stdout. It is also possible to summarize them in a list. If your document is
in a final version, any remaining fixme note will produce an error. FiXme also
comes with support for AUC-TeX.


* Changes
=========

** Version 1.2
--------------
*** Support for German thanks to Harald Harders <h.harders@tu-bs.de>


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.ins' to create the style file `fixme.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.dtx' to create the doc   file `fixme.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `fixme.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

	Have fun!
