* Description

FiXme is a collaborative annotation tool for LaTeX documents. Annotating a
document refers here to inserting meta-notes, that is, notes that do not
belong to the document itself, but rather to its development or reviewing
process. Such notes may involve things of different importance levels, ranging
from simple "fix the spelling" flags to critical "this paragraph is a lie"
mentions. Annotations like this should be visible during the development or
reviewing phase, but should normally disapear in the final version of the
document.

FiXme is designed to ease and automate the process of managing collaborative
annotations, by offering a set of predefined note levels and layouts, the
possibility to register multiple note authors, to reference annotations by
listing and indexing etc. FiXme is extensible, giving you the possibility to
create new layouts or even complete "themes", and also comes with support for
AUC-TeX.

* Installation

If you are building FiXme from the tarball you need to execute the following
steps in order to extract the necessary files. FiXme also requires the DoX
package (version 2.0, release date 2009/09/21 or later), to build. It is not
required to use the paclage.

[pdf]latex fixme.ins
[pdf]latex fixme.dtx
[pdf]latex fixme.dtx
makeindex -s gind fixme.idx
[pdf]latex fixme.dtx
[pdf]latex fixme.dtx

After that, you need to install the generated documentation and style files to
a location where LATEX can find them. For a TDS-compliant layout, the
following locations are suggested:

[TEXMF]/tex/latex/fixme/fixme.sty
[TEXMF]/tex/latex/fixme/layouts/fxlayout*.sty
[TEXMF]/tex/latex/fixme/layouts/env/fxenvlayout*.sty
[TEXMF]/tex/latex/fixme/layouts/target/fxtargetlayout*.sty
[TEXMF]/tex/latex/fixme/themes/fxtheme*.sty
[TEXMF]/doc/latex/fixme/fixme.[pdf|dvi]

If you're an AUC-TeX user, you may also install the file 'fixme.el' in a
suitable AUC-TeX style directory.
