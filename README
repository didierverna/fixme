FiXme consists of the following files:

- README (this file)
- fixme.ins
- fixme.dtx


* Description
=============

	This package provides you with a way to insert fixme notes in
documents being developped (in draft mode). Such notes can appear in the
margin of the document, as index entries, in the log file and as warnings on
stdout. It is also possible to summarize them in a list. If your document is
in a final version, any remaining fixme note will produce an error.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.ins'. This will create the style (fixme.sty).
- Run LaTeX on the file `fixme.dtx'. This will create the doc (fixme.dvi).
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.


	Have fun!
