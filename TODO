#### Is this still the case ??
* Fixme doesn't work with beamer because of \RequirePackage{verbatim} which is
  here to define the comment environnement.

* From Brian van den Broek: we should escape fixme text before putting it into
the index because of special caracters (! etc). Also, maybe mention in the doc
problems with commands like \footenotesize going into the index, and the use
of \protect.

  Okay :-) And then, that makes me think of minitoc. It would also be
nice to have local lists of fixmes and stuff...

* Internationalize the FXLog* messages
  1/ either by adding fxlog*prefix macros (dependent on the language)
  2/ or by finding a way to adapt fx*prefix macros for tty output (?!)

* See the todonotes package

* See if we want more than the silent option. For instance
  silent={log,tty,summary,all}.

* There are still some "Floats Lost" problems despite the inner mode handling.
This happens notably with the warning level, apparently because "warning" is
longer than the other prefixes.

* Provide theme/layouts or explanations for people wanting to use different
colors for authors instead of note levels.

* Instead of multiplying the layouts, it would nicer to be able to give them
options (either at the package level for external ones, or at the macro level
for all of them).

* What about enumerating the notes ?

* About testing for an empty lox file
