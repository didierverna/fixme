#### Is this still the case ??
* Fixme doesn't work with beamer because of \RequirePackage{verbatim} which is
  here to define the comment environnement.

* From Michael Kubovy:
turn fixme into a collaborative annotation tool.

* From Brian van den Broek: we should escape fixme text before putting it into
the index because of special caracters (! etc). Also, maybe mention in the doc
problems with commands like \footenotesize going into the index, and the use
of \protect.

* parler de mparhack dans la doc

  Okay :-) And then, that makes me think of minitoc. It would also be
nice to have local lists of fixmes and stuff...

I recently checked out your fixme package, and think its nice -- in
particular, I like the ability to create a list of fixmes. But, I miss
something when I compare it with my home-made comment macros (which I provide
below).

The macros I use do the following: they both highlight a section of text, and
print an associated comment. I also have made macros for different people
editing the same document, so that the comments from different people show up
with a different prefix in them.

\newcommand{\addcomment}[3]
{%
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{inline}}{\textbf{#2} [\textit{\scriptsize
#3}]}{}% comment shown inline
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{footnote}}{\textbf{#2}\footnote{\scriptsize
#3}}{}% comment as footnote
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{margin}}{\marginpar{\scriptsize #3}
\textbf{#2}}{}% comment in margin
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{hidden}}{\textbf{*#2*}}{}% highlights commented
text, but doesn't show comments
\ifthenelse{\equal{#1}{omit}}{#2}{}% nothing changed
}

% uncomment to include comments in compiled version...
\newcommand{\person1}[3][margin]{\addcomment{#1}{#2}{P1: #3}}
\newcommand{\person2}[3][margin]{\addcomment{#1}{#2}{P2: #3}}

% uncomment to omit comments from compiled version...
%\newcommand{\person1}[3][omit]{\addcomment{omit}{#2}{#3}}
%\newcommand{\person2}[3][omit]{\addcomment{omit}{#2}{#3}}

* Ask for the translation of "fatal errors" in the supported languages

* Internationalize the FXLog* messages
  1/ either by adding fxlog*prefix macros (dependent on the language)
  2/ or by finding a way to adapt fx*prefix macros for tty output (?!)

* Investigate the "Floats lost" problem with fixmes in captions
  (does not occur all the time)
  and the footnote which is not sticked to the text

* Provide a collection of themes as separate source files, redefining existing
  (or adding user) layouts. See marginnote, pdfcomment, the todonotes package
  etc. 

=> En fait,  Étudier la possibilité pour l'utilisateur de fournir ses propres
   layouts, pas seulement le UserLayout. Ce serait encore mieux pour
   marginnote, mparhack etc. 

* silent option does not shut up the summary. See if we want that, and if we
would like to add values to this option (like silent={log,tty,summary,all}
etc. 

* make innerfallback a choice key

* Après mise à jour de la doc de 4.0, revoir ltxpkg pour l'indexation et les
labels.
