#### Is this still the case ??
* Fixme doesn't work with beamer because of \RequirePackage{verbatim} which is
  here to define the comment environnement.

* From Brian van den Broek: we should escape fixme text before putting it into
the index because of special caracters (! etc). Also, maybe mention in the doc
problems with commands like \footenotesize going into the index, and the use
of \protect.

  Okay :-) And then, that makes me think of minitoc. It would also be
nice to have local lists of fixmes and stuff...

* Internationalize the FXLog* messages
  1/ either by adding fxlog*prefix macros (dependent on the language)
  2/ or by finding a way to adapt fx*prefix macros for tty output (?!)

* See if we want more than the silent option. For instance
  silent={log,tty,summary,all}.

* There are still some "Floats Lost" problems despite the inner mode handling.
This happens notably with the warning level, apparently because "warning" is
longer than the other prefixes.

* Provide theme/layouts or explanations for people wanting to use different
colors for authors instead of note levels.

* What about enumerating the notes ?

* Diego Marmsoler <diego.marmsoler@tum.de> want to sort the lox by annotation
  level. Not trivial, but here are a couple of ideas to do it:
  - generate 4 different lox files, one for each annotation level.
  - include the lox file 4 times, each time binding only one macro to non
    empty. This would require modifying the contents of this file because
    currently, \contentsline or \fxcontentsline macros are issued for all
    notes.

* The signature layout support is shaky at best. Instead, there should be two
  standard dispositions: prefix (FiXme Note: ...) and postfix/signature (Note:
  ... -- FiXme). And one option to select the wanted disposition.

* Remove every \provide and replace by utilities in main style file. This
  avoids code duplication.

* Options management improvements
  - cleanup all global options to avoid potential clashes, by prefixing like
  for face options. E.g., inline should rather be inlinelayout, etc.
  - standardize a way to provide and handle layout-specific options, in
  addition to creating new global ones. Every layout should have its own
  xkeyval family, processed automatically, we  should be able to say things
  like \fxnote[layout=[opt1=val1,opt2=val2]mylayout]{...}, etc. This would
  also help reducing the number of layouts (parametrizing them instead of
  multiplying them).
  - Review the current families and see if they really make sense, or perhaps
  rename some of them (theme?).
