* Fixme doesn't work with beamer because of \RequirePackage{verbatim} which is
  here to define the comment environnement.

* From Michael Kubovy:
turn fixme into a collaborative annotation tool.

* From Brian van den Broek: we should escape fixme text before putting it into
the index because of special caracters (! etc). Also, maybe mention in the doc
problems with commands like \footenotesize going into the index, and the use
of \protect.

* parler de mparhack dans la doc

* Revoir les hacks pour ams{book|art}. Ils ne fonctionnent pas comme les
autres (avec pretoc etc).
