#### Is this still the case ??
* Fixme doesn't work with beamer because of \RequirePackage{verbatim} which is
  here to define the comment environnement.

* From Brian van den Broek: we should escape fixme text before putting it into
the index because of special caracters (! etc). Also, maybe mention in the doc
problems with commands like \footenotesize going into the index, and the use
of \protect.

  Okay :-) And then, that makes me think of minitoc. It would also be
nice to have local lists of fixmes and stuff...

* Ask for the translation of "fatal errors" in the supported languages

* Internationalize the FXLog* messages
  1/ either by adding fxlog*prefix macros (dependent on the language)
  2/ or by finding a way to adapt fx*prefix macros for tty output (?!)

* Provide a collection of themes as separate source files, redefining existing
  (or adding user) layouts. See marginnote, pdfcomment, the todonotes package
  etc. 

* See if we want more than the silent option. For instance
  silent={log,tty,summary,all}.
