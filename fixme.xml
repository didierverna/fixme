      FiXme provides you with a way of inserting fixme notes in
      your documents. Such notes can appear inline, as marginal
      notes, footnotes, index entries, in the log file and as
      warnings on stdout. It is also possible to summarize them
      in a list. When you switch from draft to final mode, any
      remaining fixme note will be logged, but removed from the
      document's body. Additionally, critical notes will abort
      compilation with an informative message. FiXme also comes
      with support for AUC-TeX.
